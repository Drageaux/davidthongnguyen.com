      Hello, this is David! I'm a software engineer on a mission to
      <b>bridge the human-computer gap</b> without accidentally creating Skynet.
    </p>
    <p>
      My
      <b>{{ gamingExperience }} years engaging with user interfaces</b>
      in video games have made me somewhat a good judge of UX (understatement of
      the day).
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, I have programmed tools to improve my colleagues' quality of life
      by streamlining their workflows. Now I want to
      <b>work on larger ideas</b> and expand the area of influence, as much as
      imaginable.
